# published-scores
I impose royalties only for recordings that are distributed over the Internet.

I guarantee that my works are unregistered in the first 3 years after publication.
I don't charge royalties in this period.

I do not charge any royalty if the recording is distributed in a non-commercial manner.

If the royalty rate is not specified by the law, I establish it at 10% of net.

My works shall not be embedded in commercial content without my explicit consent.
